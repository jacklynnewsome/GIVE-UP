# GIVE-UP
GIVE-UP is a tool that is used to explore RNA-DNA interactions resulting from the [iMARGI pipeline](https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/imargi_pipeline/). It is an easier way just to explore the location and number of interactions instead of using [GIVE](https://zhong-lab-ucsd.github.io/GIVE_homepage/) for more complex analyses.
